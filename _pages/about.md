About Me
------
I am a first-year Master's student at the School of Software, Beihang University (Beijing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics), under the supervision of Professor [Jianwei Niu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=KOciOtEAAAAJ).
My research interests lie in Federated Learning and Computer Vision.

I am currently working on projects involving federated diffusion models, visual recognition, and generative AI techniques for image manipulation.
